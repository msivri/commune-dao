# Commune DAO
A DAO that aims to have on-chain proposals audited and approved by the community.



The Commune DAO intends to increase trust and community engagement and automate proposal executions with additional smart contracts.

**If you have suggestions, please open an issue.** *Use at your own risk.*

Each proposal is a smart contract that uses the CommuneDAO proposal interface to interface with the DAO code. The following is the flow:

1. Users may become members by purchasing DAO Tokens.
2. If members stake their tokens, they can submit proposals after a set amount of time, become auditors, and vote on proposals.
3. One token = One vote
4. Members can submit proposals in the form of smart contracts. They must stake ETH in proportion to the requested funds.
5. Members elect auditors per proposal. Every proposal may require different expertise and knowledge. Electing per proposal helps elect authoritative figures to audit the proposal and the associated smart contract.
6. Auditors can approve or deny the proposal. They may also elect to ban the proposal's author. If the proposal's author is banned, the author will lose the staked ETH and all DAO tokens as punishment. 
7. A ban requires unanimous votes. A two-thirds auditor majority must either approve or deny.
8. If approved, the proposal goes to a general vote. The general vote only requires a simple majority.
9. If the general vote approves the proposal, the associated smart contract receives the funds, triggering the smart contract to perform its intended purpose.
